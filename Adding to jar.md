(To learn how to install Cypress there is a guide [here](https://alphaver.miraheze.org/wiki/Tutorial:Installing_AlphaVers), the reobfuscated jar [here](https://github.com/FMG793/1.0.16.05_20-Cypress-Mods-And-Deobfuscated-Code/releases/tag/new), the QOL jar [here](https://github.com/FMG793/1.0.16.05_20-Cypress-Bugfix/releases/tag/Quality_of_Life_1.2))

Then, with the Edit Instance window open, select "Add to Minecraft.jar" and select the mod's zip file
