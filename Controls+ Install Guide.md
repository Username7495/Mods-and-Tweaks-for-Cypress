  Any and all client mods for Cypress can be installed in two ways, [patching the jar](https://github.com/Username7495/Mods-and-Tweaks-for-Cypress/blob/main/Jar%20Patching.md) and [adding to jar](https://github.com/Username7495/Mods-and-Tweaks-for-Cypress/blob/main/Adding%20to%20jar.md) (MultiMC/Prism only). Patching the jar will work with any launcher, it requires a computer and 7Zip, WinRAR, or file editor of choice. Adding to the jar can only be done in MultiMC and it's derivatives.
