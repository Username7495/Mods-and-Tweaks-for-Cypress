## Hmod
Hmod can be installed by patching the server jar or can be run via console.

Example: "java -classpath hmod_QoL.jar;ext1605_20_server_QoL.jar -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M Main".

When properly run, it should look like this:

### Plugins
In order to use plugins, insert it in the "plugins" folder in the directory where hmod server is located, then add plugins="filename"(without .jar at the end) in "plugins" field in server.properties.

If done properly a .properties file would have been made for it in the server folder, and it should appear as loaded in the server window
