# What is Hmod?
  Hmod is a server mod for Minecraft Alpha, and now Cypress, that allows for easier server customization and modding via plugins. Its also the base for what eventually evolved into Bukkit.
  ### NOTICE: This is NOT an installation guide. It's a guide on how to configure and use Hmod.

  ## New Files
  When running Hmod for the first time there will be some new Hmod specific files that will appear. These are: 
  
  *groups.txt*, *items.txt*, *kits.txt*, *reservelist.txt*, *users.txt*, and *whitelist.txt*. 
  
  They are all config files for new Hmod features for more server control.
