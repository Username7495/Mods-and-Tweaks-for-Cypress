# Installation Guide
  ## Controls+
  Any and all client mods for Cypress can be installed in two ways, patching the jar and adding to jar (MultiMC/Prism only). Patching the jar will work with any launcher, it requires a computer and 7Zip, WinRAR, or file editor of choice. Adding to the jar can only be done in Multi MC and it's derivatives.

  ### Adding to Jar
  To add to a jar, you will need: A MultiMC based Minecraft launcher, a Cypress instance using the REOBFUSCATED jar and any mods you would like to install.

(To learn how to install Cypress there is a guide [here](https://alphaver.miraheze.org/wiki/Tutorial:Installing_AlphaVers), and the reobfuscated jar [here](https://github.com/FMG793/1.0.16.05_20-Cypress-Mods-And-Deobfuscated-Code/releases/tag/new))

Then, with the Edit Instance window open, select "Add to Minecraft.jar" and select the mod's zip file

When complete it should look like the top when using vanilla, and bottom with optipine
